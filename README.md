# nesmon
A port of Woz Monitor for the NES/Famicom based on the code and documation from https://www.sbprojects.net/projects/apple1/wozmon.php

Joypad controls have been **removed**. Input is done through either a Family Basic Keyboard or using a compatible Keyboard Mouse Host interface (like pico-usbfamikb)
